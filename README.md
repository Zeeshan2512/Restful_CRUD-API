## About NODE.js API

I have created this project to learn how to create a Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

Live deployed link: https://restful-crud-api-f3x6.onrender.com

### API Features

The application can create, read, update and delete data, for example: products, in a database. <br />

To create a product with these attributes: <br/>
{                                                                              <br/>
	"name": "",                                                            <br/>
	"quantity": ,                                                          <br/>
	"price": ,                                                             <br/>
	"image": ""                                                            <br/>
}
